# CS-351-Project
My secure end-to-end messaging application

This project is for my Cybersecurity class in NJIT, it's an encrypted online messaging applicaiton. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to implement security protocols on a low level. 

It involves using a server to handle secure registration/login, by storing hashed passwords using salts. 

It also involves establishing an encrypted connection between two peers to allow them to chat with RSA encryption.
